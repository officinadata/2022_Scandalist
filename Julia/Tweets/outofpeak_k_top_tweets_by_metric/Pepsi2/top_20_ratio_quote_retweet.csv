khay_lah_nee,"You could make your own batter. It’s very simple. 
2 c flour
4c milk
1/4 c sugar
1/4 c oil
3-4 tbs baking soda (depending on how fluffy you want them)
1 tsp salt
2 eggs optional
Boom you’re done. 
Homemade batter tastes 10x better than this processed crap. https://t.co/NvEMYWGzKI",2020-06-16T22:22:42.000Z,,🍾Rihanna’s Child Raining Chaos🍾,NA,false,1,7,2,0,-7,1
