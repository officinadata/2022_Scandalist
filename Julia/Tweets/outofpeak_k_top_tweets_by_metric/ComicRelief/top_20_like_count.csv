CorbynistaEdith,"Every year I go to my mum's and we watch Comic Relief together. I always donate what I can, usually around £20. This year I've decided not to watch or donate as I don't want to perpetuate the ""white saviour"" image.

rodbishop15,I don’t think the NZ PM is right to call for an end to right wing extremism. She should call for an end to ALL extremism.

It does more harm than good. The money is a short term fix but the stereotypes it perpetuates are long lasting.
