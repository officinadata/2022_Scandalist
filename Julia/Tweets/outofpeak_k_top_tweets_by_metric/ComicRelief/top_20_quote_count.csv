CorbynistaEdith,"Every year I go to my mum's and we watch Comic Relief together. I always donate what I can, usually around £20. This year I've decided not to watch or donate as I don't want to perpetuate the ""white saviour"" image.

It does more harm than good. The money is a short term fix but the stereotypes it perpetuates are long lasting.
